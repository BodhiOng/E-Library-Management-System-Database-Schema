# E-Library Management System Database Schema

This is a restaurant management system developed as part of the CT042-3-1-IDB (Introduction to Databases) group assignment for the Asia Pacific University (APU) in 2024. The primary objective is to design, implement, and document a database system for an eLibrary Management System based on the given case study. The project focuses on applying redundancy control in database design and demonstrating the implementation using SQL.

## Project description

The eLibrary in Kuala Lumpur has 100 members and approximately 2,000 books across various categories. The library database needs to efficiently manage book loans, reservations, fines, member activities, and room bookings. The database should also ensure that librarians can access up-to-date information about book availability, categories, and loan statuses.
